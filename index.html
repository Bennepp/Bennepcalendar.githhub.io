        <h1>HOW TO USE:</h1>
        <p>In the script.js file, you will see the events variable (at the top). It is formatted into years, months, and days. If you want to add an event called "BOD meeting" on the 9th November, for example, you would do:</p>
        
        <pre><code>
2024: { // Year 2024
    10: { // November (Month 10) (months start at month 0)
        9: "BOD meeting", // 9th day of the month
        5: "Meeting with Bob",
    },
}, // Close the loop
        </code></pre>

        <p>This creates events in 2024, in November, on the days 9 and 5. Examples in the script include comments to help you out if you want to test it. Note: I haven't tested this on mobile, so I'm not sure if it works.</p>
        <p>Sorry for anyone actually going through my code; it's very messy.</p>

        <h1>Additional Notes:</h1>
        <p>I'm going to be broad on this as I don't want to dox myself, but the purpose of this project was to test my capabilities. I saw a school's website with an empty "virtual office" section saying you will find "the calendar." I decided to make this to see if I can integrate it myself (something that I will probably never get around to). This took about 3-4 hours total.</p>
        <p>PS. Please nobody DDOS the site. ðŸ˜…</p>

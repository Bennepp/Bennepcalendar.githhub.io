        <h1>HOW TO USE:</h1>
        <p>In the script.js file, you will see the events variable (at the top) it is formatted into years, months, and days. If you want to add an event called "BOD meeting" on the 9th November for example, you would do:</p>
        
        <pre><code>
2024: { // Year 2024
    10: { // November (Month 8) (months start at month 0, I can't be bothered to change, sorry) (jan is month 0)
        9: "BOD meeting", 
        5: "Meeting with Bob",
    },
}, // Close the loop
        </code></pre>

        <p>What this does is creates events in 2024, in November, and on the days 9 and 5. i have provided examples in the script with comments to help you out if you want to test it out. Also, i havent tested this on mobile, im not sure if if works</p>
        <p>I'm sorry for anyone thats actually going to go through my code, it's very messy </p>

        <h1>Additional notes for anyone viewing this:</h1>
        <p>I'm going to be broard on this as i don't wanna dox myself, but the purpose of this project was to honestly test if i was capable, but also because i saw on a schools website, their "virtual office" sectrion was empty, saying you will find "the calendar", despite there being nothing there. i decided to make this to see if i can integrate it into the website myself (something that i will probably never get round to tbf). this is quite half arsed (took about 3-4h total)</p>
        <p>ps. please nobody ddos the site lmao</p>
